<div class="pb-1">
    ${{$settings['towards_weekly']}} of the ${{$settings['cost_per_week']}} paid per week will go to the weekly winner.
</div>

<div class="pb-1">
    The other ${{$settings['towards_overall']}} will go into a prize pool for the overall winners at the end of the season.
</div>

<div class="pb-1">
    The top 3 finishers in the overall standings will split the overall prize pool as follows ...
</div>

<ul>
    <li>1st place will receive {{$settings['overall_1st_percent']}}% of the pool</li>
    <li>2nd place will receive {{$settings['overall_2nd_percent']}}% of the pool</li>
    <li>3rd place will receive {{$settings['overall_3rd_percent']}}% of the pool</li>
</ul>

The weekly and overall prize amounts will be posted on the site after the season starts and I know exactly how many people are participating.
