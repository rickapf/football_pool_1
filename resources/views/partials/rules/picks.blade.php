<p>You can make your picks each week in the 'PICKS' section of the site.</p>
<p>I will try to have the pick sheet posted by Tuesday evening each week.</p>
<p>There are two deadlines to be aware of when making your picks each week ...</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Thursday Deadline:</b> Any games played on Thursday must be picked by this deadline. The deadline is the start time of the 1st game played on Thursday.</li>
    <li><b>Weekend Deadline:</b> Any games played on the weekend must be picked by this deadline. The deadline is the start time of the 1st game played on the weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pick deadlines will be posted on the 'HOME' section of the site each week along with the status of your picks.</p>
<p>You can change the pick for any game as many times as you want as long as the deadline for that game has not passed. Once the deadline for a game has passed the game becomes 'locked'.</p>
<p>Make your picks each week based on who you think will win the game based on the point spread displayed on the pick sheet.</p>
<p>Please read the <b>AUTO PICKER</b>, <b>TIE BREAKERS</b>, and <b>BEST BET</b> sections for more important information regarding picks.</p>
